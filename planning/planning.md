## Carol
Hi My name is Carol, I've been with TELUS for X years. My background is in customer service with the Chinese Language Department
we are excited to be here today to present our project, Foodie Connect as full stack developers. 

For the core technologies of our web app, we utilized React, JavaScript, Express, Stream Chat API, Yelp API, and Semantic CSS. We selected React as our primary tool because it allowed us to build the app with customizable components tailored to our vision. We also integrated Stream Chat API to manage user authentication and messages within the app.

Without further ado, I'll now hand it over to Kim to take us through the exciting features of our app.

## Feature Walk-Through 

Thank you Carol

With Foodie Connect, you can utilize a variety of features to connect with other food influencers on our app, including:

- Direct messaging
- Private channels to coordinate meetups
- and Public channels to discover new food recommendations
- Furthermore, you can conveniently search for restaurants without exiting our app, - webthanks to our built-in restaurant search.

## Direct messages:
Lets take a closer look at what you can do in our chats rooms starting with a direct message
- you will be able to send and recieve messages in real-time 
- you can also respond to a particular message and express your feelings with a range of entertaining emojis.

## Private Channels
- Our user, Luigi, now wants to plan a food meet up, lets head over to the private channel section and create a channel by selecting the users and a name for the channel and clicking create to start chatting!

Our chat has the capability to edit or delete messages, which means you can communicate without fear of making mistakes. Additionally, users can send links, GIFs, and files. 

- Files can be achieved by clicking the icon or dragging and dropping the file into the chat directly

## Profile
- Before we check out the public channels you may have noticed, our user, Luigi does not have a avatar showing...
- The biggest food influencer's show their face, so lets update his profile with an avatar
- This can easily be done by selecting profile, inputting an image link and clicking update profile.

## Public Channel
Lets move over to our public channel

Within our public channels, Foodie Connect users have the ability to observe ongoing conversations among other food influencers. For instance, our user Luigi recently came across a query in the hotpot channel from Princess Peach. We'd like to highlight that users can respond with a thread in this section. 

Lets leave a recommendation for princess peach 

`Check out Dolar Shop Hotpot Happy Hour! Great portion, price and so delicous!`

as you can see now Luigi's avatar is also showing in the chat

and from here.... I'll pass it to Stanley.

# Restaurant Search:

As a Foodie Connect user, you'll love our built-in restaurant search feature that enables you to quickly access detailed information about a restaurant. Let's say you come across a tantalizing sushi recommendation in the Japanese section on the public channel and wish to share it with your friends.

Simply type in the location and cuisine type - in this case, Vancouver and Sushi - and voila! Our search function reveals the restaurant's rating, reviews, and more, all within our app. Plus, you can easily copy and share the link with your friends, making it a breeze to organize your next food adventure!

# Match Game

In addition to our impressive search functionality, we at Foodie Connect are committed to keeping our users fully engaged in the app. To this end, we have designed a fun and challenging memory game that will test your recall and decision-making skills as you explore the delicious options available.

So the next time you're torn between sushi or ramen, play our memory game while you make up your mind! With these exciting features, we are confident that Foodie Connect will become your go-to app for all things culinary.

And now, I would like to pass it on to Kim

# Conclusion
As we wrap up our presentation, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our experience.

One of the biggest obstacles we faced was selecting the right API, and navigating through an unfamiliar one without much assistance.
However, this challenge provided us with an invaluable opportunity to develop our problem-solving and debugging skills, as well as expand our knowledge and expertise with the API.

If we had more time, there are a few features we would love to add to our app. 
One such feature would be integrating a geo-location API, which would allow users to view nearby restaurants based on their current location. 

Additionally, we would like to expand the user profile section to show each user's influence power, enabling users to see who the most influential foodie of the chat are. These additions would not only enhance the user experience and engagment but also showcase our team's ability to work with different APIs and develop complex features.

Overall, we are grateful for this experience and the chance to learn and grow. We look forward to applying these lessons to our future endeavors, and we hope to continue expanding our skills and knowledge in the realm of software development.

Thank you everyone!
